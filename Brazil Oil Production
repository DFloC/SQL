In this project I wrote queries that showed oil production for Brazil.

1. Retrieved all data from Production table.
 select *
 from production;

2.Get total oil production for each year.
 
SELECT Year, SUM("Oil (m³)") AS Total_Oil_Production
FROM brazil_oil_production.production
GROUP BY Year;

3. Calculated the average production of associated petroleum gas per month.

SELECT Month, AVG("Associated petroleum gas (Mm³)") AS Avg_Associated_Gas_Production
FROM brazil_oil_production.production
GROUP BY Month;

4. Calculated the total oil and gas production for each state in June.

SELECT State, Month, SUM("Oil (m³)") AS Total_Oil_Production, SUM("Associated petroleum gas (Mm³)") AS Total_Gas_Production
FROM brazil_oil_production.production
WHERE Month = '6'
GROUP BY State, Month;

5. Found the top 10 states with the highest total oil production in 2019.

SELECT p.Year, p.State, SUM(p."Oil (m³)") AS Total_Oil_Production
FROM brazil_oil_production.production p
WHERE p.Year = '2019'
GROUP BY p.Year, p.State
ORDER BY Total_Oil_Production DESC
LIMIT 10;

6. Calculated the average water injection per month for each field and displayed only results where the average exceeds 1000 m³.

SELECT p.Field, p.Month, AVG(p."Water (m³)") AS Avg_Water_Injection
FROM brazil_oil_production.production p
GROUP BY p.Field, p.Month
HAVING AVG(p."Water (m³)") > 1000;

7. Got the monthly total oil production and gas production for each state in the Alagoas basin.

SELECT p.Basin, p.State, p.Month,
       SUM(p."Oil (m³)") AS Total_Oil_Production,
       SUM(p."Associated petroleum gas (Mm³)") AS Total_Gas_Production
FROM brazil_oil_production.production p
WHERE p.Basin = 'Alagoas'
GROUP BY p.Basin, p.State, p.Month;
